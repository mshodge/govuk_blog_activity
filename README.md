### Notes
- `Active Dates Count` indicates how many updates were made within the last 6 months (10 is the max as the scraper only loads the first page).
- `Activity` provides a visual representation of the updates using a bar chart. Each bar represents one update.
- This method has not been verified or checked, please do not assume results are 100% correct.
- Requests are limited to every 5 seconds inline with fair use policies.


### Issues
If you see an issue where the scraper is not properly collecting data from a blog, please raise an Issue.
